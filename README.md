# SonicStruct

SonicStruct is a reimplementation of Ruby's OpenStruct that avoids invalidating MRI's method caches on every instantiation.

It should be a drop in replacement for OpenStruct.

## Performance

SonicStruct is **very** fast when your OpenStructs tend to have static sets of attributes:

```
λ ruby -I./lib bench/attribute_lookup.rb
                     user     system      total        real
OpenStruct         0.730000   0.000000   0.730000 (  0.732052)
SonicStruct   0.220000   0.000000   0.220000 (  0.224770)
```

```
λ ruby -I./lib bench/attribute_assignment.rb
Attribute assignment:
                     user     system      total        real
OpenStruct         1.200000   0.000000   1.200000 (  1.196867)
SonicStruct   0.210000   0.000000   0.210000 (  0.210626)
```

```
λ ruby -I./lib bench/10_000_instantiations.rb
                     user     system      total        real
OpenStruct         0.630000   0.010000   0.640000 (  0.645598)
SonicStruct   0.240000   0.000000   0.240000 (  0.239307)
```

However, if you're using dynamically set attributes heavily, it's significantly slower:

```
λ ruby -I./lib bench/dynamic_attribute_lookup.rb
Dynamic attribute lookup:
                       user     system      total        real
OpenStruct         0.660000   0.000000   0.660000 (  0.661448)
SonicStruct   2.170000   0.010000   2.180000 (  2.174698)
```

```
λ ruby -I./lib bench/dynamic_attribute_assignment.rb
Dynamic attribute assignment:
                     user     system      total        real
OpenStruct         1.190000   0.000000   1.190000 (  1.198603)
SonicStruct   6.020000   0.010000   6.030000 (  6.015700)
```
